An application to help practice mindfulness. I started this project with my friend Evan as I was struggling to lose weight after COVID, and ended up using apps like Weight Watches and Noom - we ended up just making a simple version just taking what we liked from the application (weight logging and notes).
This is a full stack application (web, react native mobile, and a node api).
